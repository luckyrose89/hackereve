# Hackereve
Hackereve is a clone of  a hackernoon [story page](https://hackernoon.com/step-by-step-guide-to-create-3-different-types-of-loading-screens-in-react-lu2633nd) built entirely in react. This clone attempts to recreate the story page that's functional and responsive across all device widths. This project is currently hosted on Netlify at this [link](https://hackereve.netlify.app/).

## Technologies
Hackerve is built entirely with React Components with React(v17.0). It uses two plugins to render github gists and tooltips where needed. These plugins are:

 - react-gist
 - react-tooltip

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository for this project using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/luckyrose89/hackereve.git
After cloning the repository, the user must first install the project dependencies using either yarn or npm:

    yarn install
    npm install
Once you've installed all the dependencies, a node_modules folder will appear in your project folder. After this type:

    yarn start
    npm start
This command will enable the user to access Hackeve's interface in their browser on localhost:3000.
